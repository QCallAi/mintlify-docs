Webhooks is a built-in app shipped with AwazIndia, and it doesn't need to authenticate with any other external service to run.

## How to use

You will be given a webhook URL in the test substep on the editor page, and you can use it to send a GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH request to AwazIndia to trigger the flow.
